# User Authentication on a Django-React environment

In this repo, I will build the implementation of three authentication systems between Django-React:
1. Django's built-in authentication system (axios)
2. Token based authentication (dj-rest-auth)
3. OAuth 2.0 authentication (django-allauth)


The main objectives of this repo are:
1. develop a reusable framework with which I can easily replicate my Django-React user authentications
2. manage permissions with this authentication system
3. explore alternative authentication systems
